                                      -------------------------------------------

 0. Keep it simple. If you have overly complicated or over-engineered code you will loose marks

 1. Read the choco3 manual and look at the api.

 2. Make sure variable names make sense and comment your code so that I can understand it

 3. There are at least 3 different models.

 4. Maybe consider some simple form of symmetry breaking (see 10 below)

 5. Beware, some of the problem instances have no solutions

 6. Make sure your solutions verify okay using the Verify.java code given to you 
   (do not modify it as this might cause you problems when I mark your code)
   
 7. Is there a pre-processing step that could help solving?

 8. You do not need to call solver.propagate() before solving.

 9. Solutions to the hard instances are available in directory "solutions"

10. If a problem instance has a solution then it must have many solutions (see 4 above)
